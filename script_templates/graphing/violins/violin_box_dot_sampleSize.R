#this code will make a violin + boxplot + points 
#with the sample size on the x-axis
#make sure you have loaded the ggbeeswarm package to use geom_quasirandom()

# first calculate the sample size
sample_size = ___  |>  #put the data frame name here
  group_by(___)  |>    #factor here
  summarize(num = n()) #don't change anything here

#ggplot with sample sizes added
violin.plot <- ___  |>    #put the same data frame name here as above
  
  #joins the dataframe with sample size information
  left_join(sample_size, by = "___")  |>  #same factor as group_by above
  
  #makes new column with sample size below each x-axis value
  mutate(
    myaxis = paste0(___, "\n", "n=", num)) |> #same factor as group_by above
  
  ggplot(
    
    #set the aesthetics
    aes(x = myaxis,    #put column created with sample size info
        y = ___,       #continuous variable = y
        fill = ___)) + #same factor as group_by above
  
  #adds violin plot
  geom_violin(
    width = 0.5,     #spread
    alpha = 0.2) +   #transparency
  
  #adds boxplots
  geom_boxplot(width = 0.1,           #width

               color = "black",       #color of outline
               outlier.shape = NA) +  #removes outliers
  
  #adds quasirandom jittered points
  geom_quasirandom(aes(color = ___), #same factor as x and fill
                   shape = 21,       #shape as open circle
